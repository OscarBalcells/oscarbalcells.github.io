	<div id="header">Why is Blockchain technology used in RedMedic? </div>
	<div id="content">
That's a good question for two reasons. First, because it gives me the opportunity to argue why I have built RedMedic the way
I did it. And second, to demonstrate the actual application of the technology. From my point of view, there are some projects
out there that apply Blockchains, not because it's a necessary tool to build the product, but rather because it acts as the
main selling point of the project. In other words, they put the Blockchain where it's not necessary just to be able to say that they use this new technology.
If you want to discuss what I just said, send me an email.
<br><br>
The Blockchain is often sold as the futuristic platform that is most secure due to its decentralization. A Blockchain like Ethereum, what it offers you
is a computing platform that thanks to its architecture, assures you that your code will follow the exact rules you tell it to perform. Your Smart Contracts are always
executed in a transparent way always without cheating. This fundamental aspect is known as "Open Execution".
<br><br>
But the truth is that a Blockchain is as safe as the inputs it receives are valid or verifiable.
If you feed fake data into a smart contract, it will give you the fake outputs. No magic.
If you set up a supply chain for bananas based on the Blockchain, and each participant in the chain is able to lie and say that the
banana has been transported to the ideal temperature even if it has not been so, all your sophisticated Blockchain assembly is probably useless.
<br><br>
What I am going to try to do in this article is to demonstrate that Blockchain technology is a good solution to create a multi-institutional health-data hub.
<br><br>
The fact that it's' multi-institutional is a very important nuance to take into account. It means that different institutions, with different
economic interests, participate in the system.
<br>
I could tell you about why RedMedic's decentralization creates an auditable and open system and compare analogically
decentralized systems like Ethereum or Bitcoin with RedMedic to convince you that the
Blockchain is the solution, but I'm going to try another method. I borrow this method from my math classes. There are many ways to prove something.
One of them is called proof by contradiction. To prove that A = B, you demonstrate the fact that A â‰  B is impossible. We'll basically try to
take other architecture alternatives into account so that we can highlight the strong selling points a Blockchain system has.
<br><br>
I have been thinking for quite some time and have come to the conclusion that a health-data hub system can be built in three different ways.
I mean, there's more, but the different approaches can be generalised into three variants.
One of them is the one used by RedMedic: Decentralization via Blockchain. Let's look at the other two.
<br><br>
<h3>Centralized database</h3>
The first option is to have a centralized database, let's say it's operated by the company "RedMedic", which registers the digital signatures
of each patient and each caregiver, and what each participant in the network can see or change.
<br><br>
A data-guardian (health provider), upon receiving a data request, would simply query the central database for the permissions of that digital signature.
<br><br>
A patient, if he wanted to modify the permissions on who can see his medical history, would simply tell it to the central node, and it would change.
the permissions associated with that history.
<br><br>
This seems like a pretty viable option at the moment. Let us now look at the disadvantages of this system.
<br><br>
The first thing that comes to light is the security issue. The whole system is based on a single node. What happens if they hack it? If they cut off the light? The whole network will stop working.
A decentralized architecture is more resistant to security breaches because the power is distributed.
<br><br>
But most systems use a centralized architecture such as Mastercard, Amazon or the Euro,
controlled by the ECB. The central server of (which probably consists of different servers)
Mastercard has all the power in the company's payment network. Even so, the network works almost perfectly and has never completely collapsed. The fact that there is a central node does not
mean that it's an insecure system, as Mastercard shows us, because other extra-layers of security can be added.
<br><br>
RedMedic could then work with a centralized architecture. I have to admit that this is not unfeasible. The German telematic infrastructure, a database
centrally managed by Arvato (a subsidiary of Bertelsmann) connects all practices and hospitals through specialized hardware to the
central point, located in Berlin. In a single node of this network, to which thousands of health care providers belong, resides ALL data. Examples including
<a href="https://thehackernews.com/2018/01/healthcare-data-breach.html">the massive hacking of data from more than half of Norway's population </a>,
<a href="https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/category/healthcare-information-security/healthcare-attack-statistics-and-case-studies/case-study-health-insurer-anthem/#gref">
Anthem's (2nd largest insurer in the US) data breach, with 80 million stolen health profiles </a> or the
<a href="https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/labcorp-goes-down-after-network-breach-putting-millions-patient-records-risk">
115 million medical histories hacked from the American medical testing giant LabCorp </a> show that we have to stop and rethink the way
traditional systems work. Of course, there's nothing 100% secure. But data breaches have become all-too common that we can't just stop
ignoring these structural security vulnerabilities.
<br><br>
RedMedic shields the network not through obscurization, i.e. hide the code, make the functioning of the system be
more complex and the structure more opaque, ...; but proposes exactly the opposite.
<br><br>
The way to secure the system is first, distributing the risk potential among all participants. The data shouldn't be on a single node,
but distributed by all different participants. If a hacker wants to steal all the data from the system, he will have to go provider by provider hacking them all.
The second way this system ensures more secutiry is by creating a fully transparent, decentralized and auditable system. The execution of smart contract (the logic of the system) takes place in a public and accessible environment.
(the Blockchain) and this results (in theory and in many cases also practice) in a more secure system. Open Execution offers not just a fair and imparcial log recorder,
but also an unhackable logic system.
<br>
On the other hand it is necessary to take into account the regulatory and legal problem that supposes that a single company has access to the data of different suppliers of information
that in many cases compete with each other.
<br><br>
A centralized system is not totally unfeasible, but more insecure (for what I have explained before) and difficult to coordinate than the alternative.
proposed by RedMedic.
<br><br>
<h3>RedMedic through the patient </h3>
This second version of RedMedic works as follows:
<br><br>
The patient uses some tool to extract the data from his profile. For example, with an automated program that extracts data from your patient portal,
similar to what Apple's application, Health Records, does. Another option would be to rely on the law, which requires any health care provider to give a patient
all your data in the format of your choice. The problem is that sometimes this law is not complied with. In theory, extracting your data, even if it is complicated, is possible. So we jump
to the next part.
<br><br>
Once the patient has all his data organized in a single file, he goes to SellYourHealthData.com and starts making money without doing anything.
<br><br>
This system does work, doesn't it?
<br><br>
Not so fast.
<br><br>
The first fault with this system is the reliability of the data. Let's say I'm a pharmaceutical company that wants to test the effectiveness of my new drug so
I go into SellYourHealthData.com and I start buying medical records of people who have consumed the drug, to check for the effectivenss-rate.
<br><br>
How do I know this profile I just bought is authentic?
<br><br>
It may be that the seller simply invented some data and put it on sale. I'm not just throwing away the money because the information I bought
is useless, but would also be negatively altering the results of the study.
<br><br>
However, there is a way to solve this problem in order to create data markets. Simply have a medical profile signed by a trusted healthcare provider.
When you download your data from the hospital's patient portal, you ask the hospital to digitally sign the data, so that the pharmaceutical company can know that it is being used.
it's about an authentic medical history.
<br><br>
The actual that this supposed data market would have is the scale on which it operates. When a medical analytics company buys data, it does not buy 4 profiles. Buy 400,000
profiles. The data must be sold on a larger scale. That's why it is called Big Data and not Small Data. This means that in SellYourHealthData.com there will be very few
buyers at first, when there are few sellers. And because there are few buyers, there are also few sellers. It's a vicious circle that completely limits growth.
That's the main reason why SellYourHealthData.com doesn't exist. Huge health-data owners buy bulk data directly from health providers. You can see for yourself.
<br><br>
RedMedic through the patient, in my opinion, could work, as there is a real need to add all your different medical histories. There are companies that are
developing. The most important is Ciitizen. But an added profile is useful if you want to use it to take it to your doctor or if you want to donate your medical history. Not that useful
in my opinion if you want to create a huge commercial market for medical data.
<br><br>
The main problem with you controlling your own aggregated medical history yourself is that you can edit it however you want or not update it. The system I think works
is the one that includes the patient in the scheme, gives the patient control over their data, but at the same time verifies the origin and authenticity of the data at all times.
