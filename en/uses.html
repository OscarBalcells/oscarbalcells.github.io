<h2>What is a multi-institutional health data hub used for? </h2>>

That's a good question.
<br><br>
RedMedic is a system, which acts as a hub that facilitates the exchange of data between different organizations or individuals.
<br><br>
Moving medical data from an organization's database to a different person or organization is complicated for different reasons.
<br><br>
The first reason is the lack of standards within the industry. Some EHR providers don't adhere to standards and create their own
custom formats which fit perfectly with their goals. There are different standards and within those standards there are different
versions as we can see from HL7 2.0 and 3.0.
<br><br>
The second reason is the complexity of the medical data. Each system uses its own nomenclature, things are measured in different units, there are many text fields. This
complicates the understanding of the data.
<br><br>
A medical data management system like RedMedic promotes a single standard with which everyone can communicate. In addition, transactions within the system are automatic. Not anymore
there's politics in between, only computers that are much more efficient.
<br><br>
In conclusion, it could be said that a multi-institutional medical data management system creates a communication layer for the different organizations that, in many cases, are not the only ones to be able to communicate with each other.
Sometimes they have to talk to each other.
<br><br>
However, this system is not only a breakthrough for health care providers, but also for the many researchers who need a lot of data to develop new ones.
and treatments and analyse the efficacy of medicines on the market.
<br><br>
The problem as I mentioned before is that there is no large hub where all the data circulates, with the same format. RedMedic is apart from a system of
management, also a large pool of standardized data. It is a source of information for researchers for example.
<br><br>
Today, research centers buy anonymized information about their patients directly from hospitals. The fact that this information is
anonymised data also limits its potential as there are gaps in many stories to be filled, and these lost data cannot be recovered.
